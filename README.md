The game begins with the home screen. 
Upon pressing 'S' the game starts and the user will play. 

Keys needed to play:

* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project? a week
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors? Yes, with Professor Mike
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * Note it is fair to utilize some tutorials--cite them here. You **must** add your own personal touch however!
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3rkt6nZ2c&ab_channel=InvertedMinds -> the tutorial we followed for the tetris game
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1YzFl31W7c -> we followed this but added our own touch

  * (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?

     Tetris was one of the games I grew up playing and have loved, so it was really interesting how we were able to use what we have learned in class to code the game. To make it special we made our own welcome screen, rendered textures to make it look more aesthetic and we would have liked to make the blocks blown up in particles if we had more time, but that's opportunity to improve the project for the near future. 

 Another idea I thought of for the future, is to be able to reverse the tetris so the blocks would come from the bottom to the top to make it non-basic.
